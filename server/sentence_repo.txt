it was a butterfly flying just outside the wind
that was a mistake as one of the horses trotted over to the fence and whinnied
she put him in the oven to bake
the gingerbread man jumped out of the tin and ran out of the open window shouting
the cow began to chase the gingerbread man along with the pig and the little old woman
he dreamt a dream of swimming up to see the sky above
he was so short that he needed a stool to stand on to shoe the great steeds of the knights
i love you
